# 🧮 Sum to N — TypeScript Implementations

## 📘 Overview

This repository demonstrates **three approaches** to calculate the summation of numbers from `1` to `n` (`sum_to_n(n)`).
It is designed for educational purposes — to compare different algorithmic styles, complexity, and performance characteristics in **TypeScript**.

Implemented methods:
1. **Mathematical formula** – using `n * (n + 1) / 2`
2. **Iterative loop**
3. **Recursive approach**

Each method returns the same result but uses a distinct programming technique.
